            <figcaption>Some 40 light-years from Earth, a planet called TRAPPIST-1e offers a heart-stopping view: brilliant objects in a red sky, looming like larger and smaller versions of our own moon. But these are no moons. They are Earth-sized planets in a spectacular planetary system outside our own.These seven rocky worlds huddle around their small, dim, red star, like a family around a campfire.</figcaption></figure>

            <p>It was one of seven new exoplanets to be discovered orbiting the star using observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope.[4] The exoplanet is within the star's habitable zone. Since its initial announcement, the physical characteristics have become better defined, allowing scientists to better understand its nature. TRAPPIST-1e is very similar to Earth, with just about the same mass, radius, density, gravity, temperature, and stellar flux. It is also confirmed to have a compact atmosphere like the terrestrial planets in our solar system.In November 2018, researchers determined that of the seven exoplanets in the multiplanetary system, TRAPPIST-1e is the one with the greatest chance of being an Earth-like ocean world and the one most worthy of further study with regard to habitability. According to the Planetary Habitability Catalogue, Trappist 1-e is the most potentially habitable exoplanet discovered so far, with an Earth Similitary Index of 0.87.</p>
